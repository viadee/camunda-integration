# Template

This template is based on the `camunda-archetype-spring-boot` (https://github.com/camunda/camunda-archetypes).
 
# Show me the important parts

There are only slight modifications:
* Use our parent `pom.xml` in this repository 
* Use old aspectj version due to https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-assert/issues/90
